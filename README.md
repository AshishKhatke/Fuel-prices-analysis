# ⛽ Fuel Price Data Analysis Project

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of **fuel price trends** using data collected over time. The goal is to extract insights about fuel price fluctuations, patterns, and relationships using **SQL**, **Python**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Tools & Technologies Used:**
  - SQL (MySQL Workbench)
  - Python (Pandas, Nimpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
  - Excel
  - Power BI

- **Objective:**  
  To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on fuel prices and create an interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize trends, compare fuel types, and understand market behaviors.

- **Data Source:**  
  Dataset provided in `.csv` and Excel format, covering coal, crude oil, LNG, natural gas, currency rates, and market indexes.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 18 columns representing fuel and market prices, including:

- `Coal_RB_4800_FOB_London_Close_USD`
- `Coal_India_5500_CFR_London_Close_USD`
- `Price_WTI`
- `Price_Brent_Oil`
- `Price_LNG_Japan_Korea_Marker_PLATTS`
- `Price_ZAR_USD`
- `Price_Natural_Gas`
- `Price_ICE`
- `Price_Dutch_TTF`
- `Price_Indian_en_exg_rate`
...and more.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

### Using SQL (MySQL):
- Central Tendency Metrics: **Mean, Median, Mode**
- Dispersion Metrics: **Variance, Standard Deviation, Range**
- Skewness & Kurtosis for all 18 numeric columns
- Trends and correlations across fuel categories

### Using Python:
- Data Cleaning using Pandas
- Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Time series plots, histograms, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps

### Using Excel:
- Summary statistics
- Line charts and pivot tables

### Using Power BI:
- Interactive dashboard with slicers and filters
- Trend analysis by fuel type and time
- Category-wise report sections:
  - 🟠 Coal Prices
  - 🟢 Crude Oil & Natural Gas Prices
  - 🔵 Market Prices
  - ⚫ Exchange Rates
